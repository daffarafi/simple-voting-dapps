## üöÄ Backend (Smart Contract)

> ‚ö° **You can skip contract deployment!** If you just want to run the frontend and interact with the existing contract, you don't need to deploy your own contract.  
>  
> üëâ **Simply run the frontend and use the pre-deployed contract on NEAR Testnet!**  
> 
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Contract**
```sh
cd contract
cargo near build
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to NEAR Testnet**
```sh
near contract deploy <created-account> use-file ./target/near/contract.wasm without-init-call network-config testnet sign-with-legacy-keychain send
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Call the Smart Contract**
#### ‚úÖ Create a Voting Session
```sh
near call <contract-account> create_voting_session '{"title": "Election 2025", "description": "Choose the best leader", "expires_at": 1735689600000, "candidates": [["Alice", "Fair leader"], ["Bob", "Innovative thinker"]]}' --accountId <your-account>
```

#### ‚úÖ Vote for a Candidate
```sh
near call <contract-account> vote '{"candidate_id": 1}' --accountId <your-account>
```

#### ‚úÖ Get All Voting Sessions
```sh
near view <contract-account> get_all_sessions
```

---

## üåê Frontend (Next.js)

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```
> ‚ö° Or use your favorite package manager (e.g., `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, etc...).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Development Server**
```sh
npm run dev
```
Then, open **http://localhost:3000/** in your browser.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Environment Variables (Optional)**
> ‚ö° **You can skip the environment configuration!**  
> If you are not deploying your own contract or setting up your own NEAR testnet and wallet, you can **skip this step** and use the pre-configured contract and wallet setup.  

Create a **.env** file inside the `frontend/` folder and add:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=<your-deployed-contract>
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROJECT_ID=<your-wallet-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=testnet
```
